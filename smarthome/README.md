# S4-SiemLucassen-SmartHome

## About
This project focuses on finding & realizing creative 'smart home' ideas using IT Techniques featuring Machine Learning, web-applications and IoT devices.

## Technologies
I build the web application with React/NextJS so I could easily implement the API. <br>

- https://nextjs.org/

The styling was done with the use of TailwindCSS and Flexbox layout. <br>

## Demo

The application is currently hosted on the cloud application platform: <br>
Production: https://smarthome-siem-s4.herokuapp.com <br>
Detection API: https://smarthome-siem-s4.herokuapp.com/api/detection

## Project board

I like to use GitHub project board to manage the development of my project, as it is easy to use for an agile environment. <br>
